# Rachel's Favorite Pets

This application allows a user to upload images, store them in a database, and view them in a gallery.

## Motivation

Rachel's Favorite Pets is my very first project saved on github. I don't think I'll ever delete it. My now wife loves animals, so as a way to learn web development I built her a small application that allows her to upload images of her favorite animals and the view them in a gallery mode.
